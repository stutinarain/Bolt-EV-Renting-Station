# Bolt-EV-Renting-Station
Find and rent EV charging stations

Developed a user friendly and visually appealing interface that helps rent electronic vehicle stations. The concept of BOLT came from the growing need for charging stations for electric vehicles. Due to the increasing adoption of electric cars, there is a rising demand for EV Charging Stations.

Created an interface for: (i) hosts who can rent their station and earn money and (ii) drivers who can get more accessible charging spots.
People can easily locate nearby charging stations with the help of this app, along with the location details, the type of charger the station has and payment options.

A unique feature that was added is a page called "My Impact" wherein users get notified about their positive impact from using Bolt. For example, electric vehicles emit 50-60% less greenhouse gas, and such statistics can be computed for the user. They can also set their financial goals for each month which can be met by renting their station.
Designed wireframes and created prototype for the homepage, renting stations, my profile and an impact page.
